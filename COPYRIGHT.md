## Background image

The background image was cropped from a picture of the Orion Nebula,
released in the public domain by NASA, ESA, M. Robberto (Space Telescope Science Institute/ESA)
and the Hubble Space Telescope Orion Treasury Project Team.

I believe it is awesome that such pictures are made available in such an open fashion.
